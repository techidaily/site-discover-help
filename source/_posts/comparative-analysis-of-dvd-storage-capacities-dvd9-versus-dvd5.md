## What is DVD5 and DVD9

**DVD-5:** DVD-5 refers to a single-sided, single-layer disc that is supported by DVD+R/RW and DVD-R/RW. It stores about 4,700,000,000 bytes that is 4.37GB on computer. Commonly known as 4.7GB media, a DVD5 disc can store a 120-min standard-quality movie. 

**DVD-9:** DVD-9 is a later version than DVD-5\. It is a single-sided, dual-layer disc containing up to 8.5 GB or 7.95 computer GB. With DVD-R DL and DVD+R DL as the official names, DVD-9 is widely used by commercial DVDs, such as encrypted with[DVD region codes](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/), Sony ARccOS, etc, and can store a DVD movie of 240 minutes or up to 120 minutes of a file definition film. 

## DVD5 VS DVD9: Top 4 Differences You Need to Know

![dvd9 vs dvd5](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/article-image/dvd9-vs-dvd5.jpg) 

**1\. Storage Capacity**: DVD5 differs from DVD9 a lot regarding to the storage capacity, as the former is single layered while the latter is double layered. To be exact, DVD9 contains up to 8,540,000,000 bytes which is 7.95GB, twice the amount of information that a DVD5 can handle, only 4.37 gigabytes of data on it.

Just because of the storage difference, it's easy to transfer data from DVD5 to DVD9; but you need to compress the information to make its size smaller than 4.37Gb if you'd like to transfer data from DVD9 to DVD5\. Please bear in mind, you can compress the data down within the range of 70-75% for the sake of good quality compression. Or else, this will lead to a great quality loss.

**2\. Reusability**: Another big difference between DVD9 and DVD5 is the reusability. In this aspect, DVD5 edges out DVD9 because we can write on a blank DVD-5 to store information and data and make room for new data to be stored, which isn't the case with DVD9\. Once the information is stored on DVD9, we are unable to write any data on it again, which is unfriendly to environment. So DVD5 gains upper hands compared with DVD9 in this field, even though DVD9 is ideal for the movie distribution.

**3\. Price**: Price is of the prime concern among many DVD lovers in DVD5 vs DVD9 fight. Generally speaking, DVD5 is much cheaper, that's why many people store personal data on DVDs using DVD5 rather than DVD9\. 

**4\. Supported Formats:** DVD5 holds 4.7GB and is supported by DVD+R/RW and DVD-R/RW formats while DVD9 holds 8.5GB and is supported by the DVD+R and DVD-R formats. Whatever the format is, all you really need is a powerful DVD player like VLC, 5KPlayer, etc that support playing any DVDs, be it DVD5 or DVD9 with copy protection.

In short, DVD-9 can handle more data than DVD-5 as the former is comprised of two layers. But DVD5 gains more popularity because of the cheaper price. Additionally, DVD5 can be reused, which DVD9 cannot manage to do, making DVD5 more efficient and environment-friendly. This is also way many people tend to copy DVD using DVD5 instead of DVD9\.
