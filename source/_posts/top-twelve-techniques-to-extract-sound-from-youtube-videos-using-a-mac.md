## FAQs about YouTube Audio Downloader for Mac

### 1\. Is it legal to download YouTube music or audio directly?

Technically, it is not illegal to download content or convert a Youtube video to MP3\. But it is illegal to download a copyrighted music video or rip MP3 stream from a copyrighted song, and it is always against YouTube's terms of service. 

Moreover, using a file-sharing network like BitTorrent to freely download copyrighted music is illegal — unless the copyright owner (the artist, the music label, or someone else) authorizes the free use of the music. Yet, generally, it won't happen.

### 3\. Can I download YouTube videos with 5.1 Dolby Surround sound?

YouTube TV had announced that it brought Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound to its platform. Please note that it's YouTube TV, the online video streaming service, not YouTube.
