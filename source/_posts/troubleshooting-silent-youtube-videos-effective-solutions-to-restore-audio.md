## Why Do YouTube Videos Have No Sound? How to Solve it?

I can imagine how confused and frustrated you would be when you meet the YouTube no audio problem. And you might be very curious about the reasons. And so am I. After accessing to loads of detailed info and consulting to the technical experts, eventually I get the ultimate solution for YouTube no sound issues, along with some clues about the possible reasons.

### Case 1: Play Online YouTube Video with Video but No Audio

Prior to one by one list out the possible reasons, I just want to remind you to check your sound track on your computer and make sure whether it's on or not, for some of us may forget to turn on your audio device on your computer. So, this is the primary step you need to do. Besides, chances are also that the YouTube videos you are playing belong to the copy protected ones. That's to say, they don't give you full access to enjoy the contents unless you pay for them or rent them and then you are allowed to watch YouTube videos with video and audio.

So far, if you are rejected by both of the aforementioned cases, then just read the following possible 4 reasons that causes the YouTube no sound issue and that's what you need. 

**1\. Sound Setting**

Apart from your computer sound track asked to check, the sound setting on your YouTube you are watching is also the one you can't ignore. After you open the YouTube videos online, check if the audio track named Mute is labeled with a symbol "X", if so, just click it and unmute the video. Sometimes, you may scratch your head, but the YouTube audio/sound not working reason is just so simple. So at times, just don't complicate the issues.

**2\. Sound Card**

There also stands a good chance that your sound hardware takes the responsibility. And chief culprit goes to your audio manager-sound card, whose breaking or crashing will definitely result in something wrong with the YouTube video that has no sound. So if you should go to examine your sound card now?

**3\. Adobe Flash Player** 

Supposed you can playback your local media files in VLC media player or Windows Media Player with sound but have YouTube sound/audio not working trouble online, then it's advisable for you to have a careful check on your Adobe Flash Player. See if your Adobe Flash Player needs to be updated to a higher level if you are still using the older version; if you should go back to your previous version of Adobe Flash Player when you cannot get any sound in YouTube only after you update your Adobe Flash Player; or make sure if there are something in your computer store required to reinstall because of certain important data missing.

\>>> YouTube best? See the sites like YouTube and make your own judgement.

**4\. Web Browser** 

Have you ever considered the possible reason of your web browser to the YouTube sound not working? Since there are numerous web browsers here to serve for you like the common Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome and Safari, etc, you guys ought to take your web browser into consideration. When you encounter the problem of YouTube no sounds in Google Chrome, then you'd better have a try on other web browsers to make clear if YouTube videos no audio happen elsewhere. If you do not hear sound or audio when playing YouTube videos in every web browser, then the first step you should go is to update your web browser or reinstall your web browser. If this doesn't work, no worries, here I give your some practical solutions worth case by case.
